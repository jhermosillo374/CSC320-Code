Initialize the Class Grade Statistics
Create an array of 10 to store the grades 
Initialize the variables sum, max, and min 
Input a for loop that will iterate 10 times which will prompt the user to enter a grade each time
Create a while loop that will ensure the user only inputs a valid grade between 1 to 100
Use scanner.next to input the next grade
Create if conditions to execute the sum, max, and min
Break the while loop if the input is invalid
Print out "invalid grade" in else if the grade is not between 1 to 100
Calculate the average of the grades
Print out the results
